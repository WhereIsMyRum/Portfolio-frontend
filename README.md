<h1 class="title">Portfolio Frontend</h1>
<h3 class="why">Why</h3>
<p class="why">Well the answer to that question is pretty obvious. What is the point of having a portfolio website that does not have a frontend?</p>
<h3 class="what">What</h3>
<p class="what">A frontend application based on JavaScript, that utilizes Server Side Rendering thanks to the Next.js framework, as well as Client Side Rendering utilizing React.js which Next.js is built upon.</p>
<h3 class="how">How</h3>
<p class="how">Node and Next are used to create the HTML markup of the website as well as perform data injection. Client Side Rendering using React was used for components that are loaded dynamically, such as detailed view of the project or the contact tiles at the bottom of the website. They might have been Server Side Render if I followed the Next way of splitting things to different pages, but I wanted all the content to be on one page and simply inject the necessary components. For styling of components JSS was used, as an attempt on achieveing higher degree of reusability (with so-so effects, tbh), as well as CSS (initial styling of some of the components to avoid FOUC - Flash of Unstyled Components, during the page load). The form was equipped with a honey pot to avoid spam.&nbsp;All in all I am quite proud of the effect, especially because I do not know anything about design, and frontend developement is definitely not my area of expertise. I managed to create a non-ugly page, which makes me go  "yaay!".</p>
